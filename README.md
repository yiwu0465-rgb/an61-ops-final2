# AN61 Ops Console

## Overview

This is a real-time satellite operations system built for the ANT61 Beacon hackathon challenge. The system allows satellite operators to monitor their satellites for two critical orbital threats, which are conjunction events (potential collisions with debris) and coronal mass ejections (solar storms that can destroy electronics). It uses real external data sources to detect threats and provides actionable recommendations that operators can execute.
